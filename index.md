Welcome to my website

Here, I'd like to share my research ideas and findings.

My work explores how language, perception, and memory interact in the human mind. Specifically, I investigate how linguistic and sensorimotor experiences shape how we understand, remember, and relate to the world.

Sensorimotor Experience and Conceptual Knowledge
A core theme in my work is that our bodily experiences influence how we encode and retrieve conceptual knowledge. I have shown that sensorimotor dimensions (like manipulability or visual complexity) play distinct roles in memory performance—more experience is not always better. I test these effects across controlled experimental paradigms, often using concrete object concepts as a basis.

Word recognition and Word Memory
I focus on how perceptual features of language — such as imageability or sensorimotor experience — affect cognitive processes like word recognition and memory. My research shows that while high-imageability words are generally processed more easily, this advantage is not universal. In some cases, perceptual richness can actually interfere with recognition accuracy, depending on the task and memory demands.

Bilingualism
I also explore the bootstrapping role of language in maintaining complex object concepts in working memory. When perceptual load is high, linguistic labels provide a kind of cognitive anchor that helps us retain structured representations over time. This has implications for both theoretical models of working memory and practical applications in learning and communication.

Word Association and Cognitive Architecture
In recent work, I’ve examined how free word associations reflect the underlying structure of semantic memory. Using large-scale data and computational modeling, I show that both linguistic co-occurrence and sensorimotor similarity contribute to associative chains, suggesting that word association taps into a multi-layered cognitive architecture.

I study the structure of semantic memory by examining what types of information are activated during language tasks, such as word recognition, word memory, and word association generation. My work investigates how conceptual knowledge is organized and accessed, with a particular focus on how perceptual and sensorimotor dimensions (e.g., imageability, manipulability, visual complexity) shape cognitive performance. By analyzing patterns of activation across different tasks, I aim to uncover the multi-dimensional architecture of semantic memory.

In my research on word recognition and memory, I show that perceptual richness can both facilitate and interfere with performance, depending on task demands. High-imageability or high-sensorimotor words are often processed more quickly, but under certain memory conditions, they can also introduce interference, revealing important trade-offs in how perceptual information supports or hinders cognitive processing.

In the area of word association, I use large-scale datasets and computational modeling to explore how semantic memory is structured. I find that both linguistic co-occurrence patterns and sensorimotor similarity contribute to associative networks, suggesting that semantic memory is supported by multiple layers of representational information.

Expanding on these questions, I am now investigating how semantic structures operate in bilinguals, with the aim of understanding how second-language users access and organize conceptual knowledge. Here, I focus on how linguistic labels and sensorimotor experiences interact when maintaining complex concepts in working memory, especially under conditions of high perceptual load.

In new work, I am also applying EEG methods to track the dynamics of semantic activation in second-language (L2) users. By linking neural measures to behavioral performance in language tasks, I aim to characterize how semantic representations are accessed and structured in bilingual minds.
