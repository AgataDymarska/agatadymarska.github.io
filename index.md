Welcome to my website

Here, I'd like to share my research ideas and findings.

My work explores how language, perception, and memory interact in the human mind. Specifically, I investigate how linguistic and sensorimotor experiences shape how we understand, remember, and relate to the world.

Sensorimotor Experience and Conceptual Knowledge
A core theme in my work is that our bodily experiences influence how we encode and retrieve conceptual knowledge. I have shown that sensorimotor dimensions (like manipulability or visual complexity) play distinct roles in memory performance—more experience is not always better. I test these effects across controlled experimental paradigms, often using concrete object concepts as a basis.

Word recognition and Word Memory
I focus on how perceptual features of language — such as imageability or sensorimotor experience — affect cognitive processes like word recognition and memory. My research shows that while high-imageability words are generally processed more easily, this advantage is not universal. In some cases, perceptual richness can actually interfere with recognition accuracy, depending on the task and memory demands.

Bilingualism

Linguistic Scaffolding of Memory
I also explore the bootstrapping role of language in maintaining complex object concepts in working memory. When perceptual load is high, linguistic labels provide a kind of cognitive anchor that helps us retain structured representations over time. This has implications for both theoretical models of working memory and practical applications in learning and communication.

Word Association and Cognitive Architecture
In recent work, I’ve examined how free word associations reflect the underlying structure of semantic memory. Using large-scale data and computational modeling, I show that both linguistic co-occurrence and sensorimotor similarity contribute to associative chains, suggesting that word association taps into a multi-layered cognitive architecture.
