<p>Welcome to my website</p>

<p>Here, I'd like to share my research ideas and findings.</p>

<p>My work explores how language, perception, and memory interact in the human mind. Specifically, I investigate how linguistic and sensorimotor experiences shape how we understand, remember, and relate to the world.</p>

<p><b>April Publications</b>b></p>

<p>April was a great month for publications!</p>
<p>I'm excited to share three new open-access papers.</p>

<p><b>[1. Frequency over semantic richness: word recognition in non-native English speakers](https://doi.org10.1017/S1366728925000239)<b></p>

<p>I conducted a large-scale comparison of word knowledge in native and non-native English speakers. The study, published in Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, reveals key differences in sensorimotor and lexical contributions to language processing. 
In this task (data from [Brysbaert et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0267658320934) and [Mandera et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-019-01272-8)), participants were asked to indicate whether they know the meaning of a word in a paradigm which resembled a lexical decision task.</p>

<p>Non-native speakers relied more on lexical characteristics and familiarity with the word form when responding to words, as evidenced by very strong effects of word frequency on speed and accuracy of their responses. On the other hand, native speakers relied more on deep semantic processing, as found in previous word recognition literature: the stronger the semantic information associated with a word, the easier and faster it was to recognise it as a known English word.</p>

<p>However, for non-native speakers there was still a contribution of physical sensation and auditory experience to reported word knowledge, suggesting that embodied cognition does play a role in second language processing to some extent. In particular, it's possible that bodily experience, with its importance for survival, has stable enough representations that activation still takes place in L2. As for the auditory information, it's possible that non-native speakers employ sound-based strategies to recognise words.</p>

<p>Additionally, the study revealed that a word knowledge task (asking if participants know the meaning of the word) seems to tap into similar mechanisms as lexical decision (determining whether the stimulus is a real word). This makes the megastudy a useful resource to add to the study of semantic effects in word recognition.</p>

<p>Writing this paper was a lot of fun (even though it was also hard work), since it was my first paper on L2 (and my first paper outside of the lab where I "grew up" as a scientist). I'm looking forward to another deep dive into semantic representations in L2 when writing my next paper on emotional word communication in EEG hyperscanning (stay tuned!).

2. Word Associations Study
In a paper with Professor Louise Connell (Maynooth University) published in Cognition, we explored what drives activation in a word association task.
We found that local chaining from the preceding response, rather than the original cue, was the primary driver of activation. Sensorimotor relationships also played a role.
Asking participants to produce 20 associates per cue allowed us to tap into more distant associations and capture individual variability in response trajectories.







Sensorimotor Experience and Conceptual Knowledge
A core theme in my work is that our bodily experiences influence how we encode and retrieve conceptual knowledge. I have shown that sensorimotor dimensions (like manipulability or visual complexity) play distinct roles in memory performance—more experience is not always better. I test these effects across controlled experimental paradigms, often using concrete object concepts as a basis.

Word recognition and Word Memory
I focus on how perceptual features of language — such as imageability or sensorimotor experience — affect cognitive processes like word recognition and memory. My research shows that while high-imageability words are generally processed more easily, this advantage is not universal. In some cases, perceptual richness can actually interfere with recognition accuracy, depending on the task and memory demands.

Bilingualism
I also explore the bootstrapping role of language in maintaining complex object concepts in working memory. When perceptual load is high, linguistic labels provide a kind of cognitive anchor that helps us retain structured representations over time. This has implications for both theoretical models of working memory and practical applications in learning and communication.

Word Association and Cognitive Architecture
In recent work, I’ve examined how free word associations reflect the underlying structure of semantic memory. Using large-scale data and computational modeling, I show that both linguistic co-occurrence and sensorimotor similarity contribute to associative chains, suggesting that word association taps into a multi-layered cognitive architecture.
OR
I study the structure of semantic memory by examining what types of information are activated during language tasks, such as word recognition, word memory, and word association generation. My work investigates how conceptual knowledge is organized and accessed, with a particular focus on how perceptual and sensorimotor dimensions (e.g., imageability, manipulability, visual complexity) shape cognitive performance. By analyzing patterns of activation across different tasks, I aim to uncover the multi-dimensional architecture of semantic memory.

In my research on word recognition and memory, I show that perceptual richness can both facilitate and interfere with performance, depending on task demands. High-imageability or high-sensorimotor words are often processed more quickly, but under certain memory conditions, they can also introduce interference, revealing important trade-offs in how perceptual information supports or hinders cognitive processing.

In the area of word association, I use large-scale datasets and computational modeling to explore how semantic memory is structured. I find that both linguistic co-occurrence patterns and sensorimotor similarity contribute to associative networks, suggesting that semantic memory is supported by multiple layers of representational information.

Expanding on these questions, I am now investigating how semantic structures operate in bilinguals, with the aim of understanding how second-language users access and organize conceptual knowledge. Here, I focus on how linguistic labels and sensorimotor experiences interact when maintaining complex concepts in working memory, especially under conditions of high perceptual load.

In new work, I am also applying EEG methods to track the dynamics of semantic activation in second-language (L2) users. By linking neural measures to behavioral performance in language tasks, I aim to characterize how semantic representations are accessed and structured in bilingual minds.
